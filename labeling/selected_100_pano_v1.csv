Patient's father was very insistent that these teeth be restored. Explained that the treatment that can be offered here is either extraction or no treatment and that patient would need to see his general dentist to determine restorability of the teeth. Recommended patient return to general dentist to discuss options and return for another consultation appointment when an agreement has been made about which teeth are to be extracted.

Previous flippers were poorly tolerated due to patient report for poor retention.   - Recommend consultation with existing interdisciplinary team for older brother as mother has been very satisfied with care provided.
